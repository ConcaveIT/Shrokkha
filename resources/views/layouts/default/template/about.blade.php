                <p>Research & Development (R&D) are the key aspects of Shastho Shurokkha Foundation for introducing new interventions and evaluation of the existing projects and programs. There is a structural unit and expert panel within organization to conduct research in periodic manner. We believe in baseline KAP survey before giving intervention for measuring the baseline status and determine the indicators. Similarly, final KAP survey and evaluation conducts for tracking the changes including qualitative methods (FGD, KII).  Alongside, there are routine monitoring system and monthly reporting mechanism through web base application and ICT.
